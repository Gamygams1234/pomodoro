Pomodoro App README
Overview
The Pomodoro App is a time management tool built using React that helps users break their work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This method improves focus and productivity by encouraging periods of sustained concentration followed by rest.

Features
Customizable Timers: Set your preferred lengths for work sessions and breaks.
Task List: Manage your tasks directly within the app.
Progress Tracking: Visual representation of your completed pomodoros.
Notifications: Get notified when it's time to take a break or get back to work.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
